      The rose is a type of flowering shrub. Its name comes from the Latin word Rosa.
There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. The flowers of the rose grow in many different colors, from the well-known red rose or yellow rose and sometimes white or purple rose.
Rose thorns are actually prickles outgrowths of the epidermis
Roses belong to the family of plants called Rosaceae. All roses were originally wild: they grew in North America, Europe, northwest Africa and many parts of Asia and Oceania. There are over 150 different species of roses. The wild rose species can be grown in gardens, but most garden roses are cultivars, which have been selected by people.
Over hundreds of years they have been specially bred to produce a wide variety of growing habits and a broad range of colours from dark red to white including as well yellow and a bluish/lilac colour. Many roses have a strong, pleasant scent.
Most roses have spines (incorrectly called prickles) on their stems. This is a common defense system in plants.
Rose bushes are able to live in a wide variety of conditions. The fruit of the rose is called a hip or a haw or a hep. Some roses have decorative hips.
Roses in legend and in history
Roses are widely used across the world as symbols of love, sympathy or sorrow. Rose is widely used as a girl's name.
The rose was sacred to Venus. Venus was the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It was also linked with Cupid (son of Venus). He was the Roman god of desire  in one myth, he dropped nectar and the nectar bubbled up from the ground as roses. The rose was also sacred to Bacchus. He was the Roman god of wine.
Rich Romans would lie on couches with roses laid on them. They would wear roses tied onto string around their neck. Anything which was said "under the rose" was considered to be a secret.[3] Cleopatra VII of Egypt was said to have had a floor of her palace covered in roses before her lover Mark Antony visited her.

      <h1>Description and uses</h1>
      <p>
        The flower of the rose plant can be different sizes. It may be as small as 1/2 inch across to a diameter of almost 7 inches. Also, roses can be used for good scent. The scent of the rose comes from tiny perfume glands on the petals, which can be seen through a powerful microscope. 
        Sometimes rose petals are dried and packed so that you can use them for decoration or for scent.Roses can be seen in many gardens. In a big vineyard, a bush of roses are planted at the end of each row of vines. As long as the roses stay healthy, the vine growers assume their vines are healthy as well.

      <h1>Medicinal uses of rose</h1>
      <p>
        The medicinal uses of rose also include would healing. Due to rose’s astringency, high content of antioxidant phytochemicals, and its slight antimicrobial properties, rose can also help to speed up wound-healing.
        Just as rose is a flower of love and an ancient symbol of the emotional heart, it’s also an herb used to support the physical health of our hearts as well.
        even the scent of rose can have calming effects, putting our hearts and minds at ease. One study found that smelling rose oil prior to surgery, reduced the rate of preoperative anxiety
        Studies have shown that just smelling a rose can result in a measurable decrease in blood pressure and the rate of breathing, as well increased blood oxygenation
